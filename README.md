# ProofCloud

## 🧩 Project Description
**ProofCloud** is a decentralized proof-of-storage solution that allows users to register and verify digital file hashes on the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures that digital files can be validated for authenticity and ownership without relying on centralized storage systems.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To establish a **trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof record system** that enables individuals and organizations to verify the integrity of digital assets — paving the way for blockchain-powered data authenticity solutions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🧾 **Proof of Ownership:** Upload file hashes to establish timestamped ownership.  
- 🔍 **File Verification:** Verify any registered file hash for authenticity.  
- 🧠 **Tamper-Proof Records:** Immutable data records stored on-chain.  
- 🌍 **Publicly Verifiable:** Anyone can independently check file integrity.  
- 🧱 **Gas Efficient:** Optimized storage and lookup mechanisms.  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integrate with **IPFS or Arweave** for decentralized file storage.  
- Add **role-based access control** for enterprise use cases.  
- Develop **NFT-backed certificates** of proof.  
- Build a **React/Next.js frontend** for user interaction.  
- Enable **cross-chain interoperability** using Layer-2 networks.
